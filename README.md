# vba-challenge

This is my VBA Challenge submission.  I have three scripts for each of the parts of the homework.

The script called stock-market-main.vbs is the main script that has the bulk of the work requested. The sub here is called wallstreetsummaries.

The script called challenge1.vbs (\VBAStocks\challenge1.vbs) addresses the additional ask for challenge 1, and call the first script, stock-market-main.vbs. The sub here is called wsExtrema.

The script called challenge2.vbs (VBAWorksheets\challenge2.vbs) addresses the additonal ask for challenge 2, and calls the second script, challenge1.vbs.  The sub here is called runallsheets.

I saved my screenshots in a file called vba-challenge-screenshots.docx.
